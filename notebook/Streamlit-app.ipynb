    "# Architectural Styles Recognition App\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. App Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Purpose\n",
    "**Objective:** The app enables users to upload or capture images of architectural styles. It then identifies the style and provides detailed information about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Core Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Image Upload or Capture\n",
    "- **Upload Image:** Users can upload an image from their device.\n",
    "- **Capture Image:** Users can take a picture using their deviceâ€™s camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Style Recognition\n",
    "- **Automatic Detection:** The app uses a pre-trained model to recognize the architectural style from the uploaded or captured image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Information Display\n",
    "- **Style Information:** Once the style is recognized, the app displays relevant information, including a brief description, historical context, and key features of the style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Design and Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Home Page\n",
    "- **Upload/Camera Button:** Buttons to upload an image or activate the camera.\n",
    "- **Instruction Text:** Brief instructions on how to use the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Image Upload/Camera Page\n",
    "- **Upload Interface:** Section for users to select and upload an image.\n",
    "- **Camera Interface:** Section to capture a photo with a live preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Results Page\n",
    "- **Recognized Style:** Display the name of the identified architectural style.\n",
    "- **Information Section:** Show detailed information about the recognized style.\n",
    "- **Example Image:** Display an example of the architectural style for visual reference."
